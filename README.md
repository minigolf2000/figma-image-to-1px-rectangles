Select an image then Run Plugin to generate a grid of 1px rectangles from the selection

After running the plugin, try:
- Use Figma's red lines to measure distances between pixels
- Use Figma's "Select All with Same Fill" to edit pixels in groups
- Select pixels and Flatten âŒ˜E

Careful: this Plugin becomes slow for large images (larger than 200x200)
